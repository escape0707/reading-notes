# Design Patterns reading notes

## Preface to book

Design Patterns capture solutions that have developed and evolved over time.
Hence they aren't the designs people tend to generate initially. They reflect untold redesign and recoding as developers have struggled for greater reuse and flexibility in their software.

## Foreword

Consider the work of a future software archeologist, tracing the history of computing. The fossil record will likely show clear strata.

Design Patterns draws such a line of demarcation.

## Guide to readers

This book has two main parts. The first part describes what design patterns are and how they help you design object-oriented software. It includes a design case study that demonstrates hwo design patterns apply in practice. The second part of the book is a catalog of the actual design patterns.

The catalog is divided into three parts: creational, structural, and behavioral.

If you aren't an experienced object-oriented designer, then start with the simplest and most common patterns:

- Abstract Factory
- Adapter
- Composite
- Decorator
- Factory Method
- Observer
- Strategy
- Template Method

## Introduction

Design object-oriented software is hard, and designing *reusable* object-oriented software is even harder. Experienced object-oriented designers will tell you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult if not impossible to get "right" the first time. Before a design is finished, they usually try to reuse it several times, modifying it each time.

The purpose of this book is to record experience in designing object-oriented software as design patterns.

Design patterns can even improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by furnishing an explicit specification of class

### What is a Design Pattern?

In general, a pattern has four essential elements:

1. pattern name
2. problem
3. solution
4. consequences

The design patterns in the book are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.
