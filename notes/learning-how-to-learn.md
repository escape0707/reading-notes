# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects

## Week 1: What is Learning?

### Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

Either Focused, or Diffuse

Metaphor, Analogy

Focus and think, then relax and diffuse, with a timer of waking, to come up new ideas.

Learning something difficult takes time. Put your mind back and forth between the two different learning modes. Just like building up muscles. You do a little work everyday.

Learning and sleeping changes the structure of the brain (synapses). Enough sleeping after learning is very important.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

Actually working on what you don't like for a little while to witness that neuro-discomfort (procrastination) quickly disappeared.

Deal with procrastination using Pomodoro: Set a timer for 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions, focus. When you are done, give yourself a little reward. Like a few minutes of web surfing, a cup of coffee, or a bite of chocolate, even just stretching or chatting mindlessly, allowing your brain to enjoyably change its focus for a while. It's a little like doing an intense 25 minutes workout at a mental gym, followed by some mental relaxation.

Mathematical and science ideas are abstract in their nature. **Practice** with ideas and concepts to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection.

Regularly practice, solve the problem again using the method you just learned without looking at the solution. When the problem down cold, go over each step completely and concisely yet another time and even had practice on related problems. Practice makes permanent.

Working memory and long term memory.

Working memory holds only about four chunks of information.
(You may find yourself shuting your eyes to keep any other items from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate.)

The long term memory storage can store too many things, and you need **practice** and **repetition** to increase the chances that you'll be able to find what you need later when you need it.

Use *spaced repetition*, which involves repeating what you're trying to retain, but space this repetition out.

Plant the seed for you diffuse mode by first doing the focus mode work. If you are going over what you are learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. You can even set in mind that you want to dream about the material and it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it still further. Dreaming about what you are studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand.

### Optional Further Readings and Interviews

Get into interaction and construction with people and industry or labs. Get practice and communication.

If the topic and lecture is boring - it is. And try to ask a question etc. to bring up interesting topic, or get away from wasting time on it.

You can't do multiple things at the same time efficiently. (Unless trained to do one thing unconsciously, like breathing.) Save the context and switch between tasks is a way to overcome this. But remember a switching will cost time to recovery and it's better avoided.

Getting surrounded by an active, enriched environment and exercising help your neurons born and survive. (Gym class is essential and helps learning.)

Come up with a solid reason/passion to learn. A good reason to learn language is to embrace that culture.

When learning language, children have a good advantage that they allow themselves to make mistakes and can actually learn faster when overcoming this. Adults shouldn't be afraid to using the language.

To learn a language symmetrically (not only recognize but be able to come up the word and speak), you can use mnemonics rather than always link the word you want to learn with your mother-tongue. Textbook may have a limitation of text-only, it's time to use websites and apps like `memrise.com`. And use `Anki` to manage spaced repetition.

A creativity activity may not be a creativity for the world, because it was worked out before by other people, but is still a creativity for you and is important for your brain in order to pursue other creative problems.

Mind map can help you diffuse you mind and brainstorm about new ideas. You can also use it to recap on what you've just learned.

Memorizing do helps.

A big mistake of beginner writer is they edit while they write. Turn off or use a tower to cover the screen to help you avoid temptation to edit.

## Week 2: Chunking

### Chunking--The Essentials

Chunks, Illusions of competence in learning, Overlearning, Interleaving

Chunking is use your understanding, context, focus your attention, practice, and repetition to connect parts of your brain to tie together ideas to memorize them as a whole, and to make it easier to fit the chunk into a large picture.

When you are stressed your attention can't make those connections well.

Focus your undivided attention, understand, review soon after learned, close the book and test yourself, you'll find that you can't fully understand something until you can actually do it yourself. Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery.

Another important point is gaining context. Preview the material's big picture before diving in helps you fit chunks you form later better in to the whole domain.

There is a bottom up chunking process along with a top down big picture process. Context is where they meet. It means learning **when** to use which chunk.

I think you should also study the problem domain well before and along with study the concepts and solving technics.

Reread passively is much less effective than recall-restudy loop.

It's not much helpful to do concept-mapping before you've used recall-restudy to embed knowledge in your brain firmly.

Don't be fooled by some inefficient learning actions so that you think you know when you actually don't understand. Just look at the solution and think you know why and how is one of the most common illusion of competence in learning. You must have the learned concept chunked to make it easy to follow thus increase in amount of information available to your working memory.

Highlighting and underlining must be done very carefully. Otherwise it will only be ineffective and misleading. Don't let making lots of motions with your hand to fool you into thinking you've placed the concept in your brain. If you do mark up the text, try to look for main ideas before making any marks and keep your underlining or highlighting to a minimum. One sentence or less a paragraph. On the other hand, words or notes in a margin that synthesize key concepts are a very good idea.

Tests helps you recall and know how well your understanding is. Don't be afraid when mistakes appears. You learn what flaws to fix from them and it's better to find and fix flaws before real high stakes tests.

Tip. Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material. When you learn something new you can often take in subliminal cues for the room and the space around you. This can throw you off when taking tests in a different physical environment.

Acetylcholine（乙酰胆碱）, Dopamine（多巴胺）, Serotonin（血清素）, each affect our action, motivation, and social activity. Good motion is helpful to our learning.
