# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects

## Week 1: What is Learning?

### Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

Either Focused, or Diffuse

Metaphor, Analogy

Focus and think, then relax and diffuse, with a timer of waking, to come up new ideas.

Learning something difficult takes time. Put your mind back and forth between the two different learning modes. Just like building up muscles. You do a little work everyday.

Learning and sleeping changes the structure of the brain (synapses). Enough sleeping after learning is very important.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

Actually working on what you don't like for a little while to witness that neuro-discomfort (procrastination) quickly disappeared.

Deal with procrastination using Pomodoro: Set a timer for 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions, focus. When you are done, give yourself a little reward. Like a few minutes of web surfing, a cup of coffee, or a bite of chocolate, even just stretching or chatting mindlessly, allowing your brain to enjoyably change its focus for a while. It's a little like doing an intense 25 minutes workout at a mental gym, followed by some mental relaxation.

Mathematical and science ideas are abstract in their nature. **Practice** with ideas and concepts to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection.

Regularly practice, solve the problem again using the method you just learned without looking at the solution. When the problem down cold, go over each step completely and concisely yet another time and even had practice on related problems. Practice makes permanent.

Working memory and long term memory.

Working memory holds only about four chunks of information.
(You may find yourself shuting your eyes to keep any other items from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate.)

The long term memory storage can store too many things, and you need **practice** and **repetition** to increase the chances that you'll be able to find what you need later when you need it.

Use *spaced repetition*, which involves repeating what you're trying to retain, but space this repetition out.

Sleeps helps clearing toxic products cumulated during your daytime. Too little sleep over too long of a time can also be associated with all sorts of nasty conditions.

During sleep your brain tidies up ideas and concepts, erases less important parts of memories and also rehearses some of the tough parts that you need or want to remember to strengthen them. It's also as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the prefrontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another, allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping.

Of course, you must also plant the seed for you diffuse mode by first doing the focus mode work. If you are going over what you are learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. You can even set in mind that you want to dream about the material and it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it still further. Dreaming about what you are studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand.
